## 🔑 Key Features Implementation

### Zone-based Task Distribution
- City is divided into zones with geographic boundaries
- Ragpickers are assigned to specific zones
- Reports are automatically routed to ragpickers in the same zone
- Real-time notifications ensure immediate task distribution

### AI-Powered Waste Detection
- Image analysis to detect waste types automatically
- Categorization into: Plastic, Organic, Metal, Glass, E-Waste, Hazardous
- Severity assessment based on visual analysis
- Automatic tagging and categorization for better sorting

### Dynamic Reward System
- Points awarded based on waste type, weight, and severity

- `tasks` - Ragpicker task assignments
- `zones` - Geographic zones for task distribution
- `rewards` - Point and earning transactions
- `notifications` - Real-time user notifications

See `supabase-schema.sql` for the complete database schema.
